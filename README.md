# Whiteboard App
The idea is to make a whiteboard with React, but using canvas api instead of vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

## Highlights
- I can choose to use javascript or typescript or any other language that transpiles to javascript


## Progress
### [8/11]
Now its possible to draw lines, but there are still many glitches that i need to fix, one of them is that the program just draw the new element when you click to draw a new element.
